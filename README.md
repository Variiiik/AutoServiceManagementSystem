# AutoService Pro - Auto Service Management System

A comprehensive auto service management system built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. This MVP provides all essential features for managing customers, vehicles, work orders, inventory, appointments, and billing in an auto service shop.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Supabase Configuration

Before running the application, you need to set up Supabase:

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
   - Wait for the project to be fully initialized

2. **Get Your Credentials**
   - Go to Settings â†’ API in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the values with your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   ```

4. **Run Database Migration**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
   - Copy and run the SQL from `supabase/migrations/20250929202229_warm_wildflower.sql`
   - This will create all necessary tables, policies, and sample data

### 2. Development Setup
